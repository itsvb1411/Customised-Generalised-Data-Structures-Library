# Customised-Generalised-Data-Structures-Library
This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structures.
I provided the implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear data structures in an object oriented way.
I provided the generic way of implementation so anyone can use the functionality for any type of data types.  
All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
